### Life outside the internet
I follow God and attend [North Suburban Church](https://northsub.com).

I live on Chicago's North Shore with my wife, four children, and golden retriever.

I grew up in New England and root for the Red Sox (90%), Celtics (9%), Patriots (1%). I have not yet had time for the Bruins in this life.

### A few nerdy questions
- What would compilers and linkers look like if they were invented after the advent of HTTP?
- What do whole-program optimizations unlock if you can assume a program will not need garbage collection or runtime module loading?
- How far can you scale code execution on a single "machine" using ideas from the above two questions?
