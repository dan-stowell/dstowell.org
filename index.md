I'm Dan(iel) Stowell, a software engineer at [BuildBuddy](https://buildbuddy.io).

I've worked on making it easy for anyone to deploy web sites at [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and write code at [Replit](https://replit.com).

Previously I worked on recommender systems at [Canopy](https://notes.variogram.com/2022/08/01/the-story-of-canopy/), [Spotify](https://spotify.com), and [The Echo Nest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Echo_Nest).

If you want to talk to me about builds, [Bazel](https://bazel.build), or BuildBuddy, please write me at [dan@buildbuddy.io](mailto:dan@buildbuddy.io).

For everything else, please use [dstowell@gmail.com](mailto:dstowell@gmail.com).

### Allegiances
I follow God and attend [North Suburban Church](https://northsub.com).

I live on Chicago's North Shore with my wife, four children, and golden retriever.

I grew up in New England and root for the Red Sox (90%), Celtics (9%), Patriots (1%). I have not yet had time for the Bruins in this life.

### A few nerdy questions
- What would compilers and linkers look like if they were invented after the advent of HTTP?
- What do whole-program optimizations unlock if you can assume a program will not need garbage collection or runtime module loading?
- How far can you scale code execution on a single "machine" using ideas from the above two questions?
