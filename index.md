Using weaker tools can help with complexity.  
It's hard to write a complicated C program because it can't do very much.  
I'd never advocate intentionally using a weak tool, though.  
Instead, my lesson has been: write Python code like it is C.

Favor reading code over writing code.  
Reduce the amount one must remember.  
Communicate intent precisely.  
Only one obvious way to do things.  
Together we serve the users.

What people say is ruthless prioritization is just prioritization.
